# Souliss-Examples

SoulissApp is an Android Application that acts as client in Souliss Framework

You can find it published on Play store; please note that the app itself is useless unless a souliss run-time is found on a local or remote network. Have a look at the documentation to get started with Souliss.

To work on the project, just clone it from Android Studio main menu, it should compile without issues as needed libraries are encapsulated or very common.

More informations are available on wiki page, feel free to contribute. If you find app errors, please just report them via android report. If you believe the error to be 'functional', use SoulissApp tracker to create a new issue.
